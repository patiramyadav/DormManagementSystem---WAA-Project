Dormitory Managemnet System

We have decided to make this project in order to solve the problem that we, as a new students have to face. When someone new arrives at a new 
dormitory, the application would show him some of the friends from his country so that he/she would have someone to talk to and ask for 
different things. The other appealing features are: 
1. Applying for checkin and checkout form from the application itself.
2. Applying for Room Change Request
3. Applying for Maintenance Request
4. Admin can assign rooms to Students 

Technologies Used: 
1. Spring Data and JPA for Persitence
2. Spring Security for Authentication and Authorization
3. Spring MVC for Presentation 
4. MySQL as Datastore
5. Bootstrap as front end framework
6. Angular JS for Richer Client Side Experience and Consuming web services.
